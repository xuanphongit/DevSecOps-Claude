# Product Context: DevSecOps Learning Journey

## 🎯 Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
- DevOps Engineers cần evolve skills để đáp ứng security requirements ngày càng cao
- Security không còn là "afterthought" - cần shift-left security vào pipeline
- Azure ecosystem đang phát triển nhanh, cần specialized knowledge
- Gap giữa DevOps và Security teams cần được bridge

### Personal Motivation
- Chuyển từ DevOps → DevSecOps/Security Engineering
- Build portfolio với real-world security implementations
- Achieve certifications (CKS, AZ-500, SC-100)
- Position for Senior/Principal level roles

- ✅ Security gate blocking vulnerable code
- ⏳ SBOM generation automated (Week 4)

### Phase 2 (AKS Security)
- Secure-by-default AKS cluster
- RBAC & Pod Security implemented
- Network policies configured
- Runtime defense operational

### Phase 3 (IaC Security)
- Secure Terraform/Bicep modules
- Azure Policy guardrails
